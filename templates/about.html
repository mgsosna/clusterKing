<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Cluster King is a Flask app written by
    <a href="https://mattsosna.com">Matt Sosna</a>. You can check out the source code <a href="https://github.com/mgsosna/clusterKing">here</a>!
</p>

<p>
    The goal of this app is to build an intuition behind various clustering algorithms and the data they're well-suited for.
    You can generate data in various shapes (blobs, crescent moons, and rings),
    then select between three common clustering algorithms:
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering">k-means</a>,
    <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/mixture.html">Gaussian mixture models</a>, and
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBSCAN">DBSCAN</a> (density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise).
    Each of these is a form of <a href="https://www.datarobot.com/wiki/unsupervised-machine-learning/">unsupervised machine learning</a>.
</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 60px">Why do I sometimes get weird clusters?</h3>
<p>I've specifically selected data shapes that cause some algorithms to shine and others to struggle.
Blobs are easy for k-means and GMMs to partition, for example, but it's remarkably easy for DBSCAN to
believe there's only one cluster. This is partly because we explicitly tell k-means and GMMs the number of clusters
we're expecting, but also because DBSCAN's main parameter is the <i>maximum distance between points of the same cluster</i>.
This value is hard-coded to <strong>0.25</strong> in our app, meaning if you increase the noise or reduce
the distance between clusters, you're bound to get some points from each cluster below this distance threshold.

<p>
Meanwhile, k-means and Gaussian mixture models have no idea what to do with rings because the clusters have identical
x- and y-coordinates for their means. The best these algorithms can do is split the rings down the middle.
DBSCAN, meanwhile, thrives: as long as the points within each ring don't pass the minimum distance threshold
between rings, it has no problem identifying the clusters.
